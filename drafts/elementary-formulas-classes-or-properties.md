# Elementary Formulas: Classes or Properties?
## A Confusion
## Reading "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems" by Kurt Godel, Part 6

Godel defines "elementary formula" like this.

> If `b` is a term of the nth type and `a` is a term of the n + 1th type, then `a(b)` is an elementary formula.

This is confusing.

The notation looks like it means "`b` is `a`" or "`b` has the property `a`", but a few paragraphs earlier, Godel refers to terms of type greater than 1 as "classes". For example, terms of the second type are classes of numbers and terms of the third type are classes of classes of numbers. But a class is not a property.

The notation, therefore, treats a like a property while Godel calls it a class.

The problem is not syntactic; it is just a problem with the intuitive interpretation of the symbols. And it isn't that big of a problem. The concepts of Class and Property are closely related. Indeed, properties are often characterized by the set of things that have that property; i.e. a class.

Nevertheless, it creates some confusion while reading the paper.
