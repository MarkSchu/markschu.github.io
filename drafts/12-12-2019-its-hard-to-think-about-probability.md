# It's Hard to Think About Probability

Think about the following question:

> Suppose you have a collection of students. If you randomly select one student, what is the probability that the student's grade is 90%?

There are two ways to interpret this question. You can think about the probability as compared to every student in the class or the probability as compared to every student *in general*.

For some weird reason, my brain wants to assume that it's the second option, and it took me a while to realize that.

This happens to me a lot when I think about probability. My brain interprets a phrase in a particular way, but it doesn't tell me that it interprets the phrase in that way. I am then left confused.

I suspect that this phenomenon is common. And I wonder how much confusion it creates for people thinking about probabilities.
