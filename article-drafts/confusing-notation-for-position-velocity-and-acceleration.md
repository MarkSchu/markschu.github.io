# Confusing Notation: Numbers or Functions?
## Reading "The Feynman Lectures on Physics"
## Volume 1, Chapter 9

In his lectures, Feynman uses notation for position, velocity, and acceleration that is confusing since the same notation sometimes refers to a number *and* sometimes refers to a function.

Position along the x-axis, for example, is labeled `x`. `x`, however, is simultaneously used as a number, like `x = 7`, and as a function of time, like `x(t) = 2t * t`.

In other words, `x` can mean either of the following:
```text
x : Number
x : Time -> Number
```
Therefore, the phrase "the position `x`" isn't always clear; you have to think about what you're reading for a moment. The same is true for velocity `v`<sub>x</sub> and acceleration `a`<sub>x</sub>.
