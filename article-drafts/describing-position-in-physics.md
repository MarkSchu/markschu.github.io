# Describing Position in Physics

Imagine a world that is very simple. The world has two spatial dimensions - a horizontal dimension and a vertical dimension - and contains atoms with no size and no shape. Looking at this world is like looking at the stars in the night sky.

How do you describe this world mathematically?

First, you pick a random point of origin.

Second, you give every atom a horizontal coordinate that captures the horizontal distance between the atom and the origin, and a vertical coordinate that captures the vertical distance between the atom and the origin. The two coordinates describe the position of the atom in the world.

For example, there is an atom at `(3, 7)`, an atom at `(6, 4)`, and an atom at `(10, 2).`

Mathematically, the entire world is described by the list of pairs associated with each atom.
