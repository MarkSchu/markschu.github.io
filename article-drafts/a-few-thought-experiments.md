# A Few Thought Experiments
## Reading "The Feynman Lectures on Physics", Volume 1, Chapter 10, Section 2

Feynman's discussion in the second half of section 10-2 is confusing, mostly because I'm unclear what his main point is. He starts off by saying that he will infer the conservation of momentum from the principle of Galilean Relativity, that the laws of physics are the same between someone standing still and someone not accelerating. He doesn't do this, however, or at least, not by the end of section 10-2.

Instead, he goes through a series of thought experiments, the point of which, I think, is that there is insight to be gained by thinking through physical phenomena instead of thinking through equations. Here are some highlights.

First, if you think about an explosion that occurs between two objects that are exactly the same, you'll realize that it's reasonable to assume that they will move away from each other with equal and opposite velocity. That is: same body, same velocity.

Feynman points out that this assumption is reasonable precisely because it is symmetric thinking. To think that they wouldn't introduces inexplicable asymmetries. As he says, "If the objects are alike there is no reason for right or left to be preferred and so the bodies would do something that is symmetrical." This seems to be a generalization of the same body, same velocity principle to the same body, same behavior principle.

Second, you can do the same experiment with non -identical objects that have the same mass. For example, instead of two objects that are exactly the same, you can perform the experiment between a teacup and a bag of pennies that have the same mass and conclude that they too will move away from each other with equal and opposite velocity. That is: same mass, same velocity.     

Third, you can try to take the same mass, same velocity law that you just discovered and use it, instead, to define mass. You can declare, that is, that X and Y have the same mass if they are blown away from the explosion with the equal and opposite velocity; i.e. same velocity, same mass.   

This move, however, implies a lot. In particular, it implies that a third body with the same mass as the first two will have the same velocity due to the explosion. And that is a physical prediction.

Feynman says a few more things, but I'll skip them. My guess is that the points mentioned above (in addition to the ones I skipped) may be used a little later in the lectures. If not, I'm missing a singular purpose of the section.
