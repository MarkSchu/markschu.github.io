# The Expression of Newton's Second Law is Confusing

I think it's confusing to write Newton's Second Law in the form `force = mass * acceleration`.

When you read left to write, you end up reading `force = mass * acceleration` as "The force that an object experiences is equal to the mass of the object, times its acceleration." But for whatever linguistic reason, reading left to right makes it sound like the force is the result or effect of the mass times the acceleration. Of course, the reality is just the opposite. The acceleration of an object is the result of a force. This comes out when Newton's Second is written `acceleration = force/mass`. This expression reads as, "The acceleration that an object undergoes is equal to the force that the object experiences divided by the object's mass." To me, that sounds much more natural because it faithfully expresses the fact that forces cause acceleration.
