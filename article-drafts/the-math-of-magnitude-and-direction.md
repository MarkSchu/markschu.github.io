# The Math of Magnitude and Direction
## Reading the Feynman Lectures on Physics
## Volume 1, Chapter 9

Position, velocity, acceleration, and force are all described - in a two dimensional universe - with a pair of numbers like (32, -10). A pair like this means that there is a coordinate system with an origin and that there is a point 32 units from the origin along the horizontal axis in the positive direction and 10 units from the origin along the vertical axis in the negative direction.
