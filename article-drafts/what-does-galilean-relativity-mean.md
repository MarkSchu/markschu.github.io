# What Does Galilean Relativity Mean?
## Reading "The Feynman Lectures on Physics", Volume 1, Chapter 10, Section 3

The Principle of Galilean Relativity states that the laws of physics are the same as long as you're not accelerating. But what does that mean?

Consider an example.

There are two observers floating around in space. One of them is stationary; the other moves with constant velocity. And both of them take measurements on the movement of the Earth around the Sun.

The two observers will come up with discrepancies in their measurements. The velocities of the Earth and the Sun, their momentums, and their positions will all be different.

The Principle of Galilean Relativity, however, says that when they take all this discrepant data and plug it into Newton's Three Laws, the three laws will still be satisfied. They will still find that a force is required to change the acceleration of the Earth and the Sun. They will still find that the accelerations of the Earth and the Sun are equal to the forces they feel divided by the mass they have. And they will still find that the Earth exerts a force on the Sun that is as strong as the Sun's but in the opposite direction.

Another way to put it is this. Even though the numbers will differ - i.e. the measurements - the relationships between those numbers - the laws - will not change.

That's Galilean Relativity.
