# What is a Physical Law?
## Reading "The Feynman Lectures on Physics"

Think about Newton's Three Laws of Motion (written in two-dimensions).

1) At a particular moment, if the force exerted on a body is (0, 0), then the acceleration of the body is (0, 0).

2) At a particular moment, a body's acceleration is equal to the body's mass times the force exerted on the body.

3) If a body exerts a force of (x, y) on another body, then it experiences a force of (-x, -y)

What do all of these physical laws share?

At bottom, they all say something like:

> If you measure such-and-such values at a particular moment - like force or mass - then those values will satisfy such-and-such numeric relationship.

For example, the first law says that if you measure the force acting on a body, at a particular moment, and find that it's (0, 0), then if you measure the acceleration of the body at that exact same moment, you'll also find that it's (0,0).

The law tells you that if you measure two values - force and acceleration - those values will have the numeric relationship of being equal to (0, 0).

Similarly, if you measure, at a particular moment, the mass, force, and acceleration of a body, you'll always find that the values satisfy the numeric relation `force = mass * acceleration`.
