# Newton's Third Law Explained with Pool

Think of a game of pool. When a moving ball hits a stationary ball and sends it flying, the ball that does the hitting changes trajectory. In physics, a change of trajectory is an acceleration, and an acceleration only ever occurs in the presence of a force. That means that there is a force that caused the moving ball to change course.

Where does this force come from? The stationary ball wasn't doing anything; it just sat there, unmoving, until it got bumped.

As counter intuitive as it is, the force that bumped the moving ball does indeed come from the stationary ball. The reason that an unmoving ball can force another ball to change is Newton's Third Law of Mechanics: anytime something exerts a force on something else, the something-else exerts a force back. This is a basic law of physics. It's just the way the universe is built; it came this way.
