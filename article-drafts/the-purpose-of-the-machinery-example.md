# The Purpose of the Machinery Example
## Reading "The Feynman Lectures on Physics"
## Volume 1, Chapter 11, Section 1

At the beginning of chapter 11, Feynman introduces an example to talk about symmetry in physical law.

He asks us to imagine a complex machine that has many parts, all interacting via forces. I imagine the machine as a morass of gears, axels, pulleys, and levers, all pushing and pulling each other mechanically. The point is that the machine creates a complicated distribution of forces and is therefore subject to the laws of physics.

Now Feynman asks a question: If we build a copy of the machine at another location and set up both machines with the same initial configuration, will they run exactly the same?

The question, as far as I can tell, is intended to bring out a distinction between three concepts: (1) The same phenomena, (2) The same environment, and (3) the same, or symmetric, physical law. (Feynman doesn't explicitly mention environment but it plays an implicit role).

Suppose the copy does not run the same as the original; that it's not the same phenomena - i.e. (1). There can only be two reasons for this having to do with (2) and (3). Either the environment differs between the original's location and the copy's location, or the laws of physics between the locations are not the same.

Suppose, for example, that we build the copy over a geyser and that it blows the copy to smithereens while running. This is an example of the environment creating a difference in phenomena, not the laws of physics.

Alternatively, suppose we have a physical law called The Law of Earth Gravity that defines gravity in terms of how gravity works on Earth, that we build the copy on Mars, and that we notice that the difference in gravity makes the machine run slower.

In this case, The Law of Earth Gravity is not the same on Mars. To use Feynman's terminology, The Law of Earth Gravity is not symmetric with respect to a change of location.
