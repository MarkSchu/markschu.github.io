        <h1 class="">Why are Recursive Functions a Model of Computation?</h1>
        <p>Recursive Functions are a model of computation, but it can be hard to see why. Here is a perspective that brings out the computational aspect.</p>
<p>A recursive function is the result of combining the successor function, the identity function, and a constant function.</p>
<p>The successor function inputs a natural number and returns the next number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">successor(x) = x'
</code></pre>
<p>The identity function inputs a natural number and returns the exact same number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">identity(x) = x
</code></pre>
<p>A constant function inputs a natural number and returns some constant.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">constant_42(x) = 42
</code></pre>
<p>You start with these and combine them into more complex functions using composition</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">myNewFunction(x) = someFunction(someOtherFunction(x))
</code></pre>
<p>and induction</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">myNewFunction(0) = whatever
myNewFunction(x') = some recursive function that inputs either x, myNewFunction(x), or both
</code></pre>
<p>To me, the computational aspect comes out if you think in terms of steps along the natural number line. The concept of a step is very computational. Turing Machines take steps along a tape; the Lambda Calculus takes steps in the form of reductions; and programs written in high level programming languages are instructions for the computer; i.e. steps that the computer should take.</p>
<p>The successor function illustrates this perspective. Apply the successor function means taking a step right on the number line. It means taking a step to the next natural number.</p>
<p>Similarly, a constant function means that you take a step to a particular location.</p>
<p>The identity function means that you don't have to take a step. You can always just stay in the same place.</p>
<p>The rules for combining functions exhibit the same kind of thinking.</p>
<p>Composition means that you make a sequence of steps. For example, the function <code>goSomewhere</code> defined by</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">goSomewhere(x) = constant_42(identity(successor(successor(x)))
</code></pre>
<p>is understandable as the following series of steps:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">start at x
go right
go right
stay put
go to 42
</code></pre>
<p>Induction means that you can define a function by thinking in terms of steps from the function's previous value. Specifically,</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">myFunction(n') = aSeriesOfStepsFrom(n, myFunction(n))
</code></pre>
<p>means that the value of <code>myFunction(n')</code> is a series of steps from the values <code>n</code> and <code>myFunction(n)</code></p>
