<h2>An Explanation</h2>
<h2>Reading &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems&quot; by Kurt Godel, Part 5</h2>
<p>Godel's proof says that there is a statement, written in the language of the Principia, that the Principia cannot prove and cannot prove its negation.</p>
<p>So what's the statement?</p>
<p>The statement is defined in terms of the class K, so it requires a little setup.</p>
<p>The class K is a set of numbers. It's created like this. First, take all the open formulas in the Principia that have a single variable - for example, <code>x = 0</code> - and put them in a list. Since they're in a list, every formula is associated with a specific number, namely, its position in the list.</p>

<p>In the list above, <code>x = 0</code> is at position 5.</p>
<p>Next, create a list of statements from the list of formulas by replacing the free variable in the formula with the formula's position number. For example, since <code>x = 0</code> is at position 5, we get the statement <code>5 = 0</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, go through the list of propositions and decide if each proposition has a proof in the Principia or not. <code>5 = 0</code> does not have a proof.</p>

<p>A number is a member of K if it is associated with a statement that isn't provable. Since <code>5 = 0</code> is not provable and the statement is associated with the number 5, 5 is a member of K.</p>
<img src="/images/undecide5.png" />
<p>As it turns out, the metalinguistic property &quot;x is a member of K&quot; is definable in the Principia. That means that there is an open formula - call it <code>isMemberOfK(x)</code> - that satisfies the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>x is in K when <code>isMemberOfK(x)</code> has a proof</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>x is not in K when <code>~isMemberOf(x)</code> has a proof</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now for the weird part.</p>
<p>Since <code>isMemberOfK(x)</code> is an open formula with a single free variable, it is in the list of open formulas. Imagine, for no particular reason, that it's located at position 42.</p>
<img src="/images/undecide6.png" />
<p>That means that <code>isMemberOfK(42)</code> is on the list of statements.</p>
<img src="/images/undecide7.png" />
<p>The statement <code>isMemberOfK(42)</code> is the undecidable statement in Godel's proof. It and its negation do not have proofs in the Principia.</p>
