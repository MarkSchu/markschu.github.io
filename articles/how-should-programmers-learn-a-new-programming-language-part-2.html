                    <h1>How Should Programmers Learn a New Programming Language?</h1>
<h2>Part 2: What is a program and how do you run one?</h2>
<h2>Thoughts on Code</h2>
<p>(This is part 2 of 4. The intro is <a href="/articles/how-should-programmers-learn-a-new-programming-language-part-1.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In Part 1, I said that I think that the most important questions that a developer can ask when learning a new programming are:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is a program and how do you run one?</li>
<li>What are the medium sized building blocks that you build programs with?</li>
<li>What are the tools that should be on your radar?</li>
</ol>
<p>In this article, I'm going to elaborate on 1: What is a program and how do you run one?</p>
<p>This is the most important question that a programmer has to answer. At bottom, you use programs by running them; so you have to know what a program looks like and how to run it. This looks very different for different languages and for the contexts in which those languages are used.</p>
<p>For example, in web development world, websites use programs written in JavaScript. A JavaScript program is a list of instructions with no special entry point. The following, for example, is a perfectly valid JavaScript Program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log('hello!');
var foo = 42;
console.log(42 * 4);
</code></pre>
<p>In order to run it on the web, you have to send it to a web browser. Browsers read and execute JavaScript because they're JavaScript interpreters. And you tell a web browser to interpret and execute a JavaScript program by sending it a <code>.js</code> file(or by including the code in a special HTML tag).</p>
<p>For example, when you include the tag</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;https://www.mysite.com/imaprogram.js&quot; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>the browser will request <code>imaprogram.js</code> via HTTP, get the file, and run it.</p>
<p>A slightly more complicated example is TypeScript. TypeScript is a programming language that compiles into JavaScript. A TypeScript program is, like JavaScript, a file with a list of instructions and no special entry point, but it's compiled into JavaScript before being sent to the browser.</p>
<p>What about NodeJS? NodeJS is JavaScript that runs on a computer instead of a browser. A NodeJS program is just like a JavaScript-in-the-browser program but you run from the terminal. Go to the directory that includes the file - call it <code>imaprogram.js</code> - and run it using the command <code>node imaprogram.js</code></p>
<p>A very different example is Java. You don't just write Java in a file and run it with a single command on the command line. Java programs are classes with a special method called main. The method main is the program's entry point.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class ImAJavaProgram {
	public static void main(String [] args) {
    	// do stuff
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is way more structured than JavaScript. A JavaScript program is a list of whatever instructions you want. A Java program is a class; and it's a class that satisfies a particular interface. Moreover, Java is compiled.</p>
<p>There are other contexts that you have to be aware of as well.</p>
<p>For example, you need to know how to run a program locally for development versus how to run it in production. In order to run a website locally, for example, you run a web server on your computer that serves the code to localhost. Alternatively, in order to run your website on the actual web, you probably deploy it to some hosting service.</p>
<p>That's all to say, programs do not look the same from language to language and even differ based on the context in which you use the language. In order to learn a programming language, you need to know how to run a program; that is, you need to know how to press the start button.</p>
