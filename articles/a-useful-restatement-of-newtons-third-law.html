            <h1>A Restatement of Newton's Third Law that You Can Use</h1>
<p>I often hear Newton's Third Law stated as, &quot;Every action has an opposite and equal reaction.&quot; As a beginner learning physics, I don't really understand what this statement says and I certainly don't understand <em>how to use</em> it.</p>
<p>Here is a formulation of the law that I do know how to use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a particular moment, if a body exerts a force on another body, then the second body exerts a force on the first body that has the same magnitude as the original force and opposite direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how to use it.</p>
<p>Suppose, at some moment in time, that body A exerts a force of (2, 2) on body B. Assume that the force is the result of a collision.</p>

<p>Based on the third law, that is, the part that says, &quot;...then the second body exerts a force on the first body that has equal magnitude and opposite direction,&quot; you can conclude that body B exerts a force on body A.</p>
