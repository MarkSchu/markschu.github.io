            <h1>What does △x Mean?</h1>
<h2>Reading &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot;</h2>
<h2>Volume 1, Chapter 9</h2>
<p>The notation △x is read &quot;delta x.&quot;</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, △x refers to a number like 7 or 10 so that △x = 7 or △x = 10. It is used to indicate a change from the value x; it reminds you that you started somewhere, at x, and then moved away, specifically, by △x units. For example, you can use it in the sentence, &quot;Start at x and move △x units.&quot; The value you end up at is x + △x.</p>
