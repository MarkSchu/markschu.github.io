            <h1>How Should Programmers Learn a New Programming Language?</h1>
<h2>Part 1: Intro</h2>
<h2>Thoughts on Code</h2>
<p>When you already know how to program and you want to learn a new programming language, how should you start?</p>
<p>Often, the first things that tutorials describe are the basic syntax and data types of the language. They'll tell you how to write loops and conditionals, and how to manipulate strings, and they'll tell you that the language includes data types like floats, strings, and arrays.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't think that syntax is the place to start. As a programmer, you pretty much already know that the language is going to include loops, conditionals, and a way to manipulate strings. And you probably already expect to find data types that can represent numbers, lists, and key-value pairs. There are important distinctions in this area that you'll need to know, like static versus dynamic typing, but it is, for the most part, the kind of information that you can Google.</p>
<p>If you don't start with syntax then, where should you start?</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are three important questions to begin with. If you answer them, then you can pretty much Google everything else.</p>
<p>The three questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is a program and how do you run one?</li>
<li>What are the medium sized building blocks that you build programs with?</li>
<li>What are the tools that should be on your radar?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm going to write an article on each, but here's some elaboration in the meantime.</p>
<p><strong>What is a program and how do you run one?</strong></p>
<p>This is the most important question. In order to write a program, you need to know what a program in that language looks like. And once you have one, you need to know how to run it.</p>
<p>A JavaScript program, for example, is a list of JavaScript instructions with no special entry point. A Java program, on the other hand, is a class; and it's a class with a very special method called <code>main</code>; and it's something that you have to compile in order to run.
Similarly, in order to run a JavaScript program on the browser, you need to send the browser an HTML file that includes a special HTML tag that references the file with the program. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;/imaprogram.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is, again, different from Java. Java runs on your computer after you compile it. And you have to compile and start it from the command line.</p>
<p><strong>What are the medium sized building blocks that you build programs with?</strong></p>
<p>In a programming language, I like to think about things like loops, conditionals, variables, and arithmetic operations as the smallest building blocks of a programming language. One layer up are the medium sized building blocks; they're things like functions and classes. In my opinion, when you program, you think in terms of the medium sized building blocks. And they differ from language to language.</p>
<p>When you write a program in JavaScript, for example, the medium sized objects are functions and very basic classes. When you write a program in Java, you build it with classes that are much more complicated. You will also use interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism. They're what you think in terms of while you program, and that's why they're important.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tools that should be on your radar?</strong></p>
<p>Another difference between Java and JavaScript. You'll find people programming JavaScript on many different text editors, some of which are very simple like Sublime and Atom. On the other hand, you often find Java programmers using text editors like IntelliJ and Visual Studio that are much for complex and have intimate connections with Java. Many of those connections are so intimate that it becomes difficult to code without the editor (or at least, code productively). At some point, it behooves you to learn the editor in order to use the language.</p>
