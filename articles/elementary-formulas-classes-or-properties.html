<h2>A Confusion</h2>
<h2>Reading &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems&quot; by Kurt Godel, Part 6</h2>
<p>Godel defines &quot;elementary formula&quot; like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <code>b</code> is a term of the nth type and <code>a</code> is a term of the n + 1th type, then <code>a(b)</code> is an elementary formula.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is confusing.</p>
<p>The notation looks like it means &quot;<code>b</code> is <code>a</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>b</code> has the property <code>a</code>&quot;, but a few paragraphs earlier, Godel refers to terms of type greater than 1 as &quot;classes&quot;. For example, terms of the second type are classes of numbers and terms of the third type are classes of classes of numbers. But a class is not a property.</p>
<p>The notation, therefore, treats a like a property while Godel calls it a class.</p>
<p>The problem is not syntactic; it is just a problem with the intuitive interpretation of the symbols. And it isn't that big of a problem. The concepts of Class and Property are closely related. Indeed, properties are often characterized by the set of things that have that property; i.e. a class.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it creates some confusion while reading the paper.</p>
