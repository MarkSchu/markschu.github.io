                    <h1>It's Hard to Think About Probability</h1>
<p>Think about the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you have a collection of students. If you randomly select one student, what is the probability that the student's grade is 90%?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two ways to interpret this question. You can think about the probability as compared to every student in the class or the probability as compared to <em>every</em> student in general.</p>
<p>For some weird reason, my brain wants to assume that it's the second option, and it took me a while to realize that.</p>
<p>This happens to me a lot when I think about probability. My brain interprets a phrase in a particular way, but it doesn't explicitly tell me that it interprets the phrase in that way; the interpretation is unconscious.</p>
<p>I suspect that this phenomenon is common. And I wonder how much confusion it creates for people thinking about probabilities.</p>
