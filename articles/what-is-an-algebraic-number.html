<h2>Notes on Georg Cantor's &quot;On a Property of the Class of all Real Algebraic Numbers&quot;</h2>
<p>A Real Algebraic Number is a real number that solves an equation that looks, for example, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">10x^3 - 7x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
</code></pre>
<p>That is, it's an equation that's built with addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. The exponents have to be natural numbers and the numbers you multiply with have to be integers. The equation can be as long as you like; that is, it can add as many items together as you want.</p>
<p>The number 2 is an algebraic number since it is a solution to the equation</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">4x^2 + 2x - 20 = 0
</code></pre>
<p>Just swap in 12 for x and you get</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">(4)(2^2) + (2)(2) - 20
(4)(4) + (2)(2) - 20
16 + (2)(2) - 20
16 + 4 - 20
20 - 20
0
</code></pre>
<p>To be more precise, the equation looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">ax^n + bx^n-1 + ... + c = 0
</code></pre>
<p>and comes with the following restrictions:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>a, b, ... c</code> are integers with no common factor</li>
<li><code>a</code> is positive</li>
<li><code>n</code> is a positive integer</li>
</ol>
<p>The important thing to point out is that some equations have multiple solutions.</p>
