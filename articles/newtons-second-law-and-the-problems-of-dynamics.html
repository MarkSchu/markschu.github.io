            <h1>Newton‚Äôs Second Law and the Problems of Dynamics</h1>
<h2>Reading The Feynman Lectures on Physics</h2>
<h2>Volume 1, Chapter 9</h2>
<p>Newton's Second Law of Dynamics says the following. The acceleration that an object undergoes while under the influence of a force is equal to the force divided by the object's mass.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">accelerationAt(time) = forceAt(time) / mass
</code></pre>
<p>For example, if the force that an object feels at the <code>12 second</code> mark is <code>(12 Newtons, 15 Newtons)</code> and the mass of the object is <code>3 kilograms</code>, then according to the Second Law, the object will have, at the <code>12 second</code> mark, an acceleration of <code>(4 meters/second^2, 5 meters/second^2)</code>.</p>
<p>This tells you a lot. If you know the force that an object feels and the object's mass, then you know exactly how the object is going to move. Similarly, if you know how the object is accelerating, then you can figure out the force that's making it accelerate.</p>
<p>It doesn't tell you, however, what forces exist. It doesn't tell you that gravity pushes things down, that billiard balls knock each other around, that opposite magnet poles stick together, and that dropping a teacup on the floor makes it shatter. If you created a world with the second law, you'd still have to decide what forces actually exist inside it.</p>
<p>For physicists in the real world, this means that they have to discover what forces exist. And that problem - discovering forces - is another problem in the study of dynamics. That is, dynamics studies both how forces work and what forces exist.</p>
