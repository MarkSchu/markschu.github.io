                    <h1>What is a Physical Law?</h1>
<h2>Reading &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot;</h2>
<p>Think about Newton's Three Laws of Motion (written in two-dimensions).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At a particular moment, if the force exerted on a body is (0, 0), then the acceleration of the body is (0, 0).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a particular moment, a body's acceleration is equal to the body's mass times the force exerted on the body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a body exerts a force of (x, y) on another body, then it experiences a force of (-x, -y)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What do all of these physical laws share?</p>
<p>At bottom, they all say something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you measure such-and-such values at a particular moment - like force or mass - then those values will satisfy such-and-such numeric relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, the first law says that if you measure the force acting on a body, at a particular moment, and find that it's (0, 0), then if you measure the acceleration of the body at that exact same moment, you'll also find that it's (0,0).</p>
<p>The law tells you that if you measure two values - force and acceleration - those values will have the numeric relationship of being equal to (0, 0).</p>
<p>Similarly, if you measure, at a particular moment, the mass, force, and acceleration of a body, you'll always find that the values satisfy the numeric relation <code>force = mass * acceleration</code>.</p>
