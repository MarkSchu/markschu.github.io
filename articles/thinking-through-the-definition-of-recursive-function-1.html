            <h1>Thinking Through the Definition of Recursive Function</h1>
<h2>Notes on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem</h2>
<p>Start with the functions:</p>
<img src="../images/recursive1.png" />
<p>Note that B has one less argument than A and that C has one more argument than A. For example, if A has two arguments, then A, B, and C look like:</p>
<img src="../images/recursive2.png" />
<p>If A has one argument, then B is just a number - a constant - and A, B, and C look like.</p>
<img src="../images/recursive3.png" />
<p>Now for the definition.</p>
<p>The function A is <strong>recursively defined from the functions</strong> B and C when the following holds.</p>
<p>Given numbers n and x...y:</p>
<img src="../images/recursive4.png" />
<p>There's a lot going on here. For clarity, here is A with two arguments.</p>
<img src="../images/recursive5.png" />
<p>And here it is with one argument. B, in this instance, isn't a function. It is a number like 12 or 101.</p>
