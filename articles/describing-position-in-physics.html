            <h1>Describing Position in Physics</h1>
<p>Imagine a world that is very simple. The world has two spatial dimensions - a horizontal dimension and a vertical dimension - and contains atoms with no size and no shape. Looking at this world is like looking at the stars in the night sky.</p>

<p>How do you describe this world mathematically?</p>
<p>First, you pick a random point of origin.</p>
<img src="../images/position2.png" />
<p>Second, you give every atom a horizontal coordinate that captures the horizontal distance between the atom and the origin, and a vertical coordinate that captures the vertical distance between the atom and the origin. The two coordinates describe the position of the atom in the world.</p>
<img src="../images/position3.png" />
<p>For example, there is an atom at <code>(3, 7)</code>, an atom at <code>(6, 4)</code>, and an atom at <code>(10, 2).</code></p>
<p>Mathematically, the entire world is described by the list of pairs associated with each atom.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">(3, 7)
(6, 4)
(10, 2)
</code></pre>
