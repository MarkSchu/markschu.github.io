            <h1>One System of Arithmetic or All Systems?</h1>
<h2>Notes on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem</h2>
<p>In his Incompleteness Theorem, Kurt Godel proves that a particular system of arithmetic called P is undecidable.</p>
<p>Some explanations of the Incompleteness Theorem, however, says that the theorem shows that all systems of arithmetic are undecidable. For example, the Wikipedia article on it says the theorem shows &quot;...the inherent limitations of every formal axiomatic system capable of modeling basic arithmetic.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to square this; how does the undecidability of P show the undecidability of <em>every</em> other arithmetic system?</p>
<p>I'm sure Godel mentions something in the article, but here's a guess. The undecidability of P does not explicitly demonstrate the undecidability of every arithmetic system. <em>But</em>, the methods of proof are clear enough to apply to other systems. And that's enough to have confidence in the undecidability of all systems.</p>
