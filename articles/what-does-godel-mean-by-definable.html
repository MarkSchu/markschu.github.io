<h2>A Confusion</h2>
<h2>Reading &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems&quot; by Kurt Godel, Part 4</h2>
<p>Godel, in the intro to the theorem, uses the phrase, &quot;definable in the system,&quot; without fully explaining what he means.</p>
<p>I imagine a fuller explanation is coming, but I think he means something like this.</p>
<p>Outside of the Principia, in the metalanguage, you can think about arithmetic properties and propositions like &quot;x equals 2&quot; and &quot;1 + 4 equals 5&quot;. And importantly, you can think about whether or not they're True. &quot;1 + 4 equals 5&quot; is true and &quot;4 equals 2&quot; is false. There's nothing tricky going on here; it's just the way we intuitively talk about numbers every day.</p>
<p>By &quot;definable&quot;, I think Godel means something like this.</p>
<p>A property in the metalanguage is definable in the system when there is a formula P in the Principia such that the property is True of x just when Px has a proof.</p>
<p>A proposition in the metalanguage is definable when there is a formula P in the Principia such that the proposition is true just when P has a proof.</p>
<p>For example, the property &quot;x equals 0&quot; in the metalanguage is definable by the formula x = 0 in the Principia since x equals 0 is True precisely when x = 0 has a proof.</p>
