# The Two Central Concepts: Deciding and Expressing
## Reading "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems" by Kurt Godel, Part 1

From the intro:

>"It is reasonable therefore to make the conjecture that these axioms and rules of inference are also sufficient to decide all mathematical questions which can be formally expressed in the given system."

This is the claim that Godel's Theorem addresses. Can you decide every mathematical statement that you can express in the system of Principia Mathematica?

Included in this question are two big concepts: the concept of deciding a mathematical question and the concept of expressing a mathematical question.

From here on out, we need to track the development of these two concepts since they're central to the question on the table.

What are they?

As far as I'm aware, much of the theorem is concerned with fleshing the concepts out; here is the little that I know about them right now.

The concept of deciding a mathematical question is fairly straightforward. Deciding a mathematical question means deciding a mathematical statement. And a system decides a statement if it either proves the statement or proves its negation. For example, the Principia proves `0 < 1`; therefore, the Principia decides `0 < 1`.

The concept of expressing a mathematical statement is less clear to me. I believe it has something to do with the language of the formal system. A mathematical proposition that you grasp intuitively is expressible in the system if there is a formula that "captures" that intuition.

For example, you have an intuitive grasp of the concepts zero and one. And based on that intuition, you know that zero is less than one. This statement is expressed in the language of Principia as `0 < 1`. And if the system did not include `0` or a primitive symbol that represents zero, then it would not be expressible.
