# Proofs and Expectations

If I presented an axiom system that consisted of one axiom and one rule of deduction and pointed out that there are statements that the system can't decide, you wouldn't be surprised. And you wouldn't be surprised because you wouldn't expect such a simple system to decide every statement.

Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, which says that there are statements that Russell & Whitehead's "Principia Mathematica" doesn't decide, however, was surprising. And the reason it was surprising was that people thought that "Principia Mathematica" might really decide every single mathematical statement. That is, they expected it to do so.

The surprise of the Incompleteness Theorem, then, comes down to expectations. It comes down to your expectations about which systems are decidable and which systems aren't.

And that leaves you with an interesting question: Given an axiom system, why think that it is or isn't decidable?
