# What is Newton's Third Law of Motion?
## Reading "The Feynman Lectures on Physics"
## Volume 1, Chapter 9, Section 1

Newton's Third Law of Motion says this: When an object exerts a force on another object, then the second object exerts a second force on the first object. The second force has the same magnitude as the initial force and the opposite direction.

For example, suppose that an atom called X pushes an atom called Y with a force of (2, 4). Newton's Third Law says that there is another force, (-2, -4), that pushes back on X. (-2, -4) has the same magnitude as (2, 4) since
sqrt(2^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(-2^2 + -4^2)
and it has the opposite direction since (2, 4) + (-2, -4) = 0.

The same is true for a force that pulls. If atom X pulls on Y with a force of (10, -12), then Y pulls on X with a force of (-10, 12). Again, they have the same magnitude since
sqrt(10^2 + -12^2) = sqrt(-10^2 + 12^2)
and the opposite direction since (10, -12) + (-10, 12) = 0.

The Third Law says something very interesting about the universe. It says that objects don't interact for free. If an object forces another object to change, then the first object will change as well. If you push something, you get pushed back. If you pull something, you get pulled back. There is no way to force an object to do something without *being forced* to do something.
