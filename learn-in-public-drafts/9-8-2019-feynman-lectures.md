At the beginning of his lectures, Feynman lays out the "atomic hypothesis":

"All things are made of atoms...attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another."

This description of the world, according to Feynman, contains the most information using the fewest number of words.

Suppose that you want to design a universe according to Feynman's Atomic Hypothesis. What decisions do you have to make to create an actual implementation? There are a lot. Here are a few.

First, do atoms have a size? In the real world, atoms are around 0.000000008 cm to 0.000000016 cm wide. But you don't have to give them a size. They can just be point particles.

Second, at what distance are atoms close enough to repel each other? This question is only interesting if there are other values to compare it with, such as the size of an atom or the amount of force that repels or attracts atoms. The question is interesting if there are ratios to identify.

Third, when two atoms repel and attract, in what directions do the atoms move? It seems obvious that the directions will be opposite and parallel like things are in the real world, but it doesn't have have to be.

Fourth, when two atoms repel and attract, how fast will the atoms change their respective directions? In the real world, the magnitudes are equal and opposite, but again, they don't have to be.
